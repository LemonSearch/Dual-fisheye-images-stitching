- final_notebook.ipynb: contains the code used for the production of our final results.
- linear_vs_sigmoid.ipynb: contains our linear  vs  sigmoid  masks.
- luminance_correction: contains exploration on brightness adjustment. The method used can be found  in final_notebook.
- luminances_saved.json: are required to  run the final_notebook brightness adjustment method.
- stitching.ipynb: contains exploration on  vignetting
- evalutation.ipynb: is used to compare our methods against other solutions.
